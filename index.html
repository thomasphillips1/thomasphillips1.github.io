        overview</h1>
    <p>This challenge series is designed to assess your ability to complete the configurations identified in different
        scenarios as part of a Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare deployment.</p>
    <p>The challenges in this series are:
    <ul>
        <li>Deploying a Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare environment challenge</li>
        <li>Deploying a patient intake process challenge</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>You will have <strong>thirty (30) days</strong> to complete the challenges in the challenge series.
    <h1 id="microsoft-cloud-for-healthcare-challenge-format">Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare challenge format</h1>
    During this challenge series, you will be presented with multiple scenarios. You must successfully complete the
    tasks in each scenario to pass the overall challenge.</p>
    <p>Each scenario will describe the environment and present tasks you must complete to be successful and move to the
        next scenario.</p>
    <p>Each challenge scenario contains a scenario description, tasks, and resources. The scenario provides information
        about the environment and an overview of what you need to accomplish. The task section lists the specific items
        that you must complete to successfully pass the scenario. Additional tasks will list other items that you will
        need to complete for the challenge. These are often used to help facilitate the challenge experience and not
        necessarily tasks you would otherwise find in a production deployment. Finally, the resource section will list
        items like user names and passwords provided as part of the scenario.</p>
    <p>Once you&#39;ve finished a scenario&#39;s tasks, you will submit your work for evaluation using the
        <strong>Check your work</strong> button. There may be some scenarios that do not have an option to check your
        work. This may occur when multiple scenarios are checked at a later time. Be sure to complete all objectives in a scenario
        regardless of a check your work option.
    </p>
    <p>To continue to the next challenge scenario, you must receive a green check mark after checking your work. If you
        are not successful, you should review the scenario, correct any errors, and then check your work again.</p>
    </p>In each scenario an <strong>Ask for help</strong> button is available to you. This help button will reveal
        guidance for configuring the tasks found in the scenario. Although help is available in each scenario, using the
        help option more than the allotted times will result in a failure to successfully complete the overall challenge. For
        example, if your challenge has 20 scenarios, you may be allowed to use help for 50% of the scenarios or 10
        times. If you use help 11 or more times, you will fail the overall challenge and be required to start the challenge series
        again.</p>
