        overview</h1>
    This challenge series is designed to assess your ability to complete the configurations identified in different
    scenarios as part of a Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare deployment.
    The two challenges in this series are:
    <ul>
        <li>Deploying a Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare environment challenge</li>
        <li>Deploying a patient intake process challenge</li>
    </ul>
    You will have <strong>thirty (30) days</strong> to complete the challenges in the challenge series.
    <h1 id="microsoft-cloud-for-healthcare-challenge-format">Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare challenge format</h1>
    During this challenge series, you will be presented with multiple scenarios. You must successfully complete the
    tasks in each scenario to pass the overall challenge.<br>
    Each scenario will describe the environment and present tasks you must complete to be successful and move to the
    next scenario.<br>
    Each challenge scenario contains a scenario description, tasks, and resources. The scenario provides information
    about the environment and an overview of what you need to accomplish. The task section lists the specific items
    that you must complete to successfully pass the scenario. Additional tasks will list other items that you will
    need
    to complete for the challenge. These are often used to help facilitate the challenge experience and not
    necessarily tasks you would otherwise find in a production deployment. Finally, the resource section will list
    items like user
    names and passwords provided as part of the scenario.<br>
    Once you&#39;ve finished a scenario&#39;s tasks, you will submit your work for evaluation using the
    <strong>Check
        your work</strong> button. There may be some scenarios that do not have an option to check your work. This
    may
    occur when multiple scenarios are checked at a later time. Be sure to complete all objectives in a scenario
    regardless of a check your work option.<br>
    To continue to the next challenge scenario, you must receive a green check mark after checking your work. If you
    are
    not successful, you should review the scenario, correct any errors, and then check your work again.<br>
    In each scenario an <strong>Ask for help</strong> button is available to you. This help button will reveal
    guidance
    for configuring the tasks found in the scenario. Although help is available in each scenario, using the help
    option
    more than the allotted times will result in a failure to successfully complete the overall challenge. For
    example,
    if your challenge has 20 scenarios, you may be allowed to use help for 50% of the scenarios or 10 times. If you
    use
    help 11 or more times, you will fail the overall challenge and be required to start the challenge series again.
